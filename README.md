### Next Steps:
- **Start Date:** We can begin developing this minimal test template today.
- **Review and Feedback:** This initial test will help us ensure we are on the right path and provide a foundation for further development.
- **Deliverable:** A basic web page with the above functionalities, along with the relevant API endpoints.
Please let us know if you have any questions or need further clarification on the initial task. We look forward to seeing the first draft and moving forward with the project.
